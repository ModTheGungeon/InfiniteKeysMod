# No metadata.txt in your .zip? No problem!
# ETGMod will set Name to the .zip name, Version to 0.0 and DLL to mod.dll

Name: Infinite Keys
Version: 1.0

# The DLL path must be the full CASE-SENSITIVE path of the DLL in the .zip.
# For example, if it's just ExampleMod.dll, it's ExampleMod.dll
# If it's in the directory ADir, it's ADir/ExampleMod.dll (or ADir\ExampleMod.dll, we don't care).
# If, for some reason, you screw up your DLL path, don't worry - ETGMod will pick the first one.

DLL: InfKeysMod.dll

# All your dependencies (APIs / backends you're using).

# Nothin'
